FishTank
========

In an attempt to refresh my knowledge in objective-c, I created this tiny fish-tank simulator. I remember making something like this in school (C++) so figured, why not. Would be cooler if the fish interacted with each other. Perhaps in the future. I'm posting this for any objective-c new commers that want to look at the language.

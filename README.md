**FISHTANK**
============

In an attempt to refresh my knowledge in objective-c, I created this tiny fish-tank simulator. I remember making something like this in school (in C++) so figured, why not. Posting this for anyone who is just getting into objective-c.

**TODO:**
- Make fish interact with one another

**INSTRUCTIONS**

Open project in XCode. Compile. Gaze at the wonderful ASCII fish in debug window.
